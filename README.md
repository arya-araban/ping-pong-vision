I was tasked as the computer vision lead of a robotics project which aimed to create a life-sized ping-pong playing robot. I was able to achieve many of the vision tasks that were needed for this project.

these include: 
- Tracking the ping-pong ball and getting its real world locations in each frame 
- Getting the speed of the ping-pong ball in each frame
- Plotting the trajectory of the moving ping-pong ball 
- Predicting the ball's movement based on the trajectory 
- Tracking the ping-pong racket with markers, and getting the Euler angles of the racket in each frame. 


Note: The code made public here represents the prototyping stage of the project. The final implementation was transitioned to a proprietary Python and OpenCV-based system for real-time processing.
